## Team Rules

- Everyone contributes equally to the project.
- Attend scheduled meetings and daily stand-ups.
- Communicate blockers or issues as soon as possible.

## Contributions
- All work must go through GitHub Issues and branches.
- Use clear commit messages and keep code documented.
- Follow the agreed GitFlow process (`master`, `develop`, `release`, `feature`).

## Reporting Problems
